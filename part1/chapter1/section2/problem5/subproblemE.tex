Show that if \(f\) has both a left inverse \(g\) and a right inverse \(h\), then
\(f\) is bijective and \(g = h = \inverse{f}\).

\begin{thm}
	A function with both a left and a right inverse is bijective.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(f\) be a function with both a left inverse and a right inverse. By
	\thref{s2p5at3}, we know \(f\) is injective. By \thref{s2p5at4}, we know
	\(f\) is surjective. Therefore by definition, we know that \(f\) is
	bijective.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
	If a function has both a left and a right inverse, then these inverses
	are equal and the inverse is unique.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	\todo{}
\end{proof}
