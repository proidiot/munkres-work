\[\{(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 < 1\}\]

\begin{thm}
	The set \(\setbuild{(x,y)}{x^2 + y^2 < 1}\) is not a cartesian product
	of subsets of \(\reals\).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Choose \(x_1 = 0.9\), \(y_1 = 0\), \(x_2 = 0\), and \(y_2 = 0.9\). Note
	that \((x_1,y_1) = (0.9,0)\) is in the set since
	\({x_1}^2 + {y_1}^2 = {0.9}^2 + {0}^2 = 0.81 < 1\). Also note that
	\((x_2,y_2) = (0,0.9)\) is in the set since
	\({x_2}^2 + {y_2}^2 = {0}^2 + {0.9}^2 = 0.81 < 1\). However, the pair
	\((x_1,y_2) = (0.9,0.9)\) is not in the set, as
	\({x_1}^2 + {y_2}^2 = {0.9}^2 + {0.9}^2 = 1.62 \centernot< 1\).
\end{proof}
