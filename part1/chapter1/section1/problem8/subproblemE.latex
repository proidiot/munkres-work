\begin{remark}[Why \(\powerset{A}\) is called the power set]
	The power set of some set is so-called as the set resulting from the
	power set construction operation has a cardinality equal to 2
	exponentiated to the power of the cardinality of the set on which the
	power set operation is performed. Symbolically, that is (given a set
	\(A\)):
	\[\card{\powerset{A}} = 2^{\card{A}}\]
