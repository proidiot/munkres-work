Show that injective functions preserve set difference. Symbolically, that is:
\[([f(a) = f(a')] \implies [a = a']) \implies f(A_0 \without A_1) = f(A_0) \without f(A_1)\]

\begin{thm}
	Set difference distributes through the image of an injective function.
	Symbolically, given \(\mapping{f}{A}{B}\) such that
	\(f(a) = f(a')\) implies \(a = a'\), and given \(A_0 \subset A\) and
	\(A_1 \subset A\), that is:
	\[f(A_0 \without A_1) = f(A_0) \without f(A_1)\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets, and let \(f\) be a mapping from \(A\) to
	\(B\) such that \(f(a) = f(a')\) implies \(a = a'\), and let \(A_0\) and
	\(A_1\) be a subsets of \(A\).

	First, assume \(y\) is in \(f(A_0 \without A_1)\). By the definition of
	image, we know that there exists \(x\) in \(A_0 \without A_1\) such that
	\(y = f(x)\). By the definition of set difference, we see that both
	\(x\) is in \(A_0\) and \(x\) is not in \(A_1\). Recalling that
	\(y = f(x)\), we can say that \(y\) is in \(f(A_0)\) and that \(y\) is
	not in \(f(A_1)\). So \(y\) is in \(f(A_0) \without f(A_1)\) by the
	definition of set difference. Thus \(f(A_0 \without A_1)\) is a subset
	of \(f(A_0) \without f(A_1)\).

	Next, assume \(y\) is in \(f(A_0) \without f(A_1)\). By the definition
	of set difference, we see that \(y\) is in \(f(A_0)\) and \(y\) is not
	in \(f(A_1)\). We know that there must exist some \(x\) in \(A_0\) such
	that \(y = f(x)\) and there is no \(x'\) in \(A_1\) such that
	\(y = f(x')\) by the definition of image. As \(x\) is a value for which
	\(y = f(x)\), we know that \(x\) is not in \(A_1\). Since \(x\) is in
	\(A_0\) and \(x\) is not in \(A_1\), we can say that \(x\) is in
	\(A_0 \without A_1\) by the definition of set difference. Recalling that
	\(y = f(x)\), we have that \(y\) is in \(f(A_0 \without A_1)\) by the
	definition of image. Thus \(f(A_0) \without f(A_1)\) is a subset of
	\(f(A_0 \without A_1)\).

	As we have shown that \(f(A_0 \without A_1)\) and
	\(f(A_0) \without f(A_1)\) are subsets of each other, we have
	demonstrated set equality.
\end{proof}
