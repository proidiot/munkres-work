\(x \isin \arbitraryintersection{A \in \metaset{A}}{A} \implies x \isin A\) for
at least one \(A \in \metaset{A}\).

\begin{thm}[Implication holds in~\ref{5c}]\thlabel{5ct}
	Given \(\metaset{A}\) is a nonempty collection of sets, for every \(x\)
	in the generalized intersection over all sets in \(\metaset{A}\), there
	exists some set \(A\) in \(\metaset{A}\) such that \(x\) is in \(A\).
	Symbolically, that is
	\[x \isin \Arbitraryintersection{A \in \metaset{A}}{A} \implies x \isin \setbuild{x'}{\thereexists A \in \metaset{A} \suchthat x' \isin A}\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(\metaset{A}\) be a nonempty collection of sets, and let
	\(\metaset{A}_0\) be some set in \(\metaset{A}\). It is possible
	that the generalized intersection over \(\metaset{A}\) is empty, but
	instead we will consider the non-vacuous case. Let \(x\) be in the
	generalized intersection over \(\metaset{A}\). By definition, we know
	that \(x\) is a member of every set in \(\metaset{A}\), and so \(x\) is
	in \(\metaset{A}_0\) in particular. So there exists at least one set
	\(A\) in \(\metaset{A}\) for which \(x\) is in \(A\).
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Implication fails for the converse of~\ref{5c}]
	Given \(\metaset{A}\) is a nonempty collection of sets, it is not the
	case that for every \(x\) which is in at least one set of
	\(\metaset{A}\), that \(x\) is also in the generalized intersection over
	all sets in \(\metaset{A}\). Symbolically, that is
	\[\itisnothecasethat{x \isin \setbuild{x'}{\exists A \in \metaset{A} \suchthat x' \isin A} \implies x \isin \Arbitraryintersection{A \in \metaset{A}}{A}}\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Choose \(\metaset{A}\) to be \(\{\{1\},\{1,2\}\}\), which is a nonempty
	collection of sets. Note that the set \(\{1,2\}\) is in \(\metaset{A}\),
	that 2 is in \(\{1,2\}\), and that there exists a set in \(\metaset{A}\)
	such that 2 is in that set. So choose \(x\) to be 2. Using the
	definition of the generalized intersection, we calculate the generalized
	intersection of our choice for \(\metaset{A}\) in particular to be the
	set \(\{1\}\). Despite there existing some set in \(\metaset{A}\) to
	which \(x\) is a member, our choice of \(x\) is not in the generalized
	intersection over \(\metaset{A}\). So it is not always the case that a
	value being in some set in \(\metaset{A}\) is sufficient for that value
	to also be in the generalized intersection over \(\metaset{A}\).
\end{proof}
