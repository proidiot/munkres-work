\[\{(x, y) | y > x\}\]

\begin{thm}
	The set \(\setbuild{(x,y)}{y > x}\) is not a cartesian product of two
	subsets of \(\reals\).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Choose \(x_1 = 0\), \(y_1 = 1\), \(x_2 = 1\), and \(y_2 = 2\). Note that
	\((x_1,y_1) = (0,1)\) is in the set, as is \((x_2,y_2) = (1,2)\).
	However, the pair \((x_2,y_1) = (1,1)\) is not in the set. So the set
	cannot be a cartesian product.
\end{proof}
