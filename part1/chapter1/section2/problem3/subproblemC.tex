Show that \(\ref{s2p2f}\) holds for arbitrary unions.
\begin{thm}
	The image under some function of an arbitrary union is equal to the
	arbitrary union of images under the function. Symbolically, that is:
	\[f\left(\Arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i}\right) = \Arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{f\left(\metaset{A}_i\right)}\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets, let \(f\) be a mapping from \(A\) to \(B\),
	let \(\metaset{A}\) be a collection of subsets of \(A\), and let
	\(\metaset{A}_i\) be the \(i\)-th member of \(\metaset{A}\).

	First, assume \(y\) is in
	\(f(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i})\). By the
	definition of image under a function, we know that there exists \(x\) in
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i}\) such that
	\(y = f(x)\). Rephrasing in terms of \(\metaset{A}\), we see that \(x\)
	is in \(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \in \metaset{A}}{\metaset{A}_i}\).
	With the definition of arbitrary union, we know that \(x\) is in some
	member set \(\metaset{A}'\) of \(\metaset{A}\). Recalling that
	\(y = f(x)\), we know \(y\) is in \(f(\metaset{A}')\). Again using the
	definition of arbitrary union, we can say that \(y\) is in
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \in \metaset{A}}{f(\metaset{A}_i)}\).
	Rephrasing in terms of \(A\), we see that \(y\) is in
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{f(\metaset{A}_i)}\). Thus
	\(f(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i})\) is a
	subset of
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{f(\metaset{A}_i)}\).

	Next, assume \(y\) is in
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{f(\metaset{A}_i)}\).
	Rephrasing in terms of \(\metaset{A}\), we see that \(y\) is in
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \in \metaset{A}}{f(\metaset{A}_i)}\).
	With the definition of arbitrary union, we know that \(y\) is in
	\(f(\metaset{A}')\) for some member set \(\metaset{A}'\) of
	\(\metaset{A}\). By the definition of image under a function, we know
	there exists \(x\) in \(\metaset{A}'\) such that \(y = f(x)\). Again
	using the definition of arbitrary union, we can say that \(x\) is in
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \in \metaset{A}}{\metaset{A}_i}\).
	Rephrasing in terms of \(A\), we see that \(x\) is in
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i}\). Recalling
	that \(y = f(x)\), we have that \(y\) is in
	\(f(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i})\) by the
	definition of image under a function. Thus
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{f(\metaset{A}_i)}\) is a
	subset of
	\(f(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i})\).

	As we have shown that
	\(f(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{\metaset{A}_i})\) and
	\(\arbitraryunion{\metaset{A}_i \subset A}{f(\metaset{A}_i)}\) are
	subsets of each other, we have demonstrated set equality.
\end{proof}
