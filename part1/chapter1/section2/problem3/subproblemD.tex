Show that the subset relation from \(\ref{s2p2g}\) holds for arbitrary
intersections.

\begin{thm}\thlabel{s2p3dt}
	The image under some function of an arbitrary intersection is a subset
	of the arbitrary intersection of images under the function.
	Symbolically, given a collection \(\metaset{A}\) of subsets of \(A\),
	that is:
	\[f\left(\Arbitraryintersection{A_i \in \metaset{A}}{A_i}\right) \subset \Arbitraryintersection{A_i \in \metaset{A}}{f\left(A_i\right)}\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets, let \(f\) be a mapping from \(A\) to \(B\),
	and let \(\metaset{A}\) be a collection of subsets of \(A\).

	Assume \(y\) is in
	\(f(\arbitraryintersection{A_i \in \metaset{A}}{A_i})\). With the
	definition of image under a function, we can say there must exist \(x\)
	in \(\arbitraryintersection{A_i \in \metaset{A}}{A_i}\) such that
	\(y = f(x)\). We know that \(x\) must be in every set \(A_i\) in
	\(\metaset{A}\) due to the definition of arbitrary intersection. By
	universal instantiation, we'll say \(x\) is in \(A'\). Recalling that
	\(y = f(x)\), we can say that \(y\) is in \(f(A')\) due to the
	definition of image under a function. By universal generalization, we
	can also say that \(y\) is in \(f(A_i)\) for every \(A_i\) in
	\(\metaset{A}\). By the definition of arbitrary intersection, we know
	that \(y\) is in
	\(\arbitraryintersection{A_i \in \metaset{A}}{f(A_i)}\). Therefore
	\(f(\arbitraryintersection{A_i \in \metaset{A}}{A_i})\) is a subset of
	\(\arbitraryintersection{A_i \in \metaset{A}}{f(A_i)}\).
\end{proof}
